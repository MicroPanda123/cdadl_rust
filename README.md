# CDADL in rust
It's (gonna be) rewrite of [cdadl](https://github.com/MicroPanda123/cdadl)

# Usage
For now it's like this, you need to run [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver), using `./geckodriver -p 4444`, then in `main.rs` change `{link}` to link to CDA folder (for now it only works for folders because.). And then after running `cargo run` it **should** print out links after some time.
